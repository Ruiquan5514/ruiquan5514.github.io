Hi there, my name is Ruiquan Huang (pronounced _Ray-chwen Hwang_, you are also welcome to call me Ray). I am a Ph.D. candidate at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://psu.edu), and am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jing Yang](https://jing-yang7.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), and M.S. degrees from Columbia University.
